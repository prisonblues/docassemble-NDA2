Each Party may use Confidential Information of other Party only and to the extent strictly necessary for the Purpose and in accordance with this Agreement. Any copy or summary of such Confidential Information made by the Recipient shall be deemed to be and shall be clearly identified as Confidential Information.

Subject to and in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement, a Recipient may only disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to an Authorised Person.

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES
